Here's the corrected version with working badge icons. The issue is usually with the logo names - they need to match exactly what shields.io supports:

## Overview

This repository provides a friendly, modular roadmap to learn and master **core data science skills** using NumPy, Pandas, and SQL â€” especially useful for preparing data for machine learning.

**Goals:**

- Teach key libraries in hands-on notebooks
- Provide EDA, feature engineering, and visualization modules
- Maintain modular, well-documented assets for learning

## Study Timeline

| Week | Focus              | Key Concepts                     | Mini Project             |
|------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1    | NumPy Basics       | Arrays, Shapes, Indexing         | Vector Math              |
| 2    | Array Ops & Math   | Broadcasting, Dot Product        | Linear Algebra Demo      |
| 3    | Pandas Foundations | Series, DataFrames, Indexing     | CSV Data Analysis        |
| 4    | Pandas Advanced    | GroupBy, Joins, Aggregations     | Sales Data Exploration   |
| 5    | SQL Basics         | SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY          | SQL Query Practice       |
| 6    | SQL Advanced       | Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations  | Database Case Study      |

You can proceed at your own pace â€” modules are loosely coupled.

---

## Best Practices

- **NumPy:** Use vectorized operations, avoid Python loops.
- **Pandas:** Start with `df.info()` / `df.describe()`, chain operations.
- **SQL:** Begin with simple queries; then build up joins and subqueries.
- **Math & Stats Foundations:** Reinforce linear algebra and statistics as you learn.

---

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/Obiwankenobi699/Basic_DataScience-4ML.git
cd Basic_DataScience-4ML
jupyter notebook
```

For the SQL parts, you can use SQLite or your preferred SQL client.

---

## Modules & Details

- **EDA:** Exploratory data analysis, distributions, visual reports
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming variables, encoding, selection
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, imputation, scaling
- **NumPy:** Array operations, broadcasting, linear algebra
- **Pandas:** Data wrangling, merges, aggregation
- **SQL:** Joins, subqueries, database-driven examples

**Changes made:**
1. Used proper logo names (`python`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `jupyter`)
2. Added `style=for-the-badge` for better appearance
3. Used official brand colors for each technology
4. Fixed the badge URLs to work correctly

The icons should now display properly in your GitHub README!
